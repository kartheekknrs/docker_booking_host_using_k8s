# Doctor Appointment Website ü•º
A doctor appointment website build with mongodb, express, reactjs and nodejs.

# üí°About this project 
Doctor Appointment website quite useful website. In this project it consists of 3 parts. First one is backend, second one is frontend and last one is admin. You can easly sign up and sign in that page. And then you can see home, all doctors , about and contact page. If you go to the all doctor page you can choose specialization of doctor. If you choose one doctor after doing that immediately will going to the doctor personel page, and then you will choose easely appontment date. If maybe you change you desicion, you should profile page and cancel you appointment. I gave some rights the admin panel. A few of them, add a doctor personel information, graduation, specialization and picture and so on. This website I made three weeks it took quite such a long time but it's very developing myself and learn lots of new things.
